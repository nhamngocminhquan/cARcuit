# Introduction
cARcuit respects your privacy and the permissions you give the application. Your data used within our application is not shared beyond your device and is not recorded, unless you choose to do so (in the case of circuit files saving and opening.)
# How cARcuit uses your data
We require camera usage only for the facilitation of the AR environment. cARcuit does not access your data nor record them, with the exception of your circuit files, which belong to you and you have full control over. We do not require internet access, do not acquire your personal nor public data and do not access other information not related to the cARcuit application on your device. 
# Why cARcuit stores your data
The circuit files you save will be retained by your device so that you can open them again later. We do not retrieve the files and do not share them with anyone else.
